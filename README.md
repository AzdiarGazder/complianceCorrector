This script demonstrates how to automatically correct uniaxial tension test data for compliance.

- Initial input requires uniaxial tension test data containing time, displacement and force. 
- Following that, compliance correction is undertaken using a theoretically estimated elastic modulus and a calculated effective compliance values.
